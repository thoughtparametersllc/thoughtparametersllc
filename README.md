## 👋 Hi, I'm Jason Lee Miller

Welcome to **Thought Parameters LLC**! I'm passionate about building secure, scalable infrastructure and helping organizations transform their DevOps and Cybersecurity practices.

### 🚀 About Me

I've spent over 15 years in the DevOps and Cybersecurity space, working with amazing companies like **Apple**, **Netflix**, **Workday**, and many others to architect mission-critical infrastructure, automate complex workflows, and strengthen security postures. My journey has taken me from system engineering to leading comprehensive DevSecOps initiatives across multi-cloud environments.

Currently, I'm focused on:
- 🔐 **DevSecOps & Cloud Security** - Building secure-by-design infrastructure with automated compliance
- ☁️ **Multi-Cloud Architecture** - Designing resilient systems across AWS, GCP, and Azure
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code** - Leveraging Terraform, CloudFormation, and modern IaC practices
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity** - Vulnerability management, SIEM operations, and GRC frameworks
