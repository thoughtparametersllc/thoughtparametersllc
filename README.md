## 📌 About Me

Some people build with bricks, I build with code. Whether it's securing digital environments, automating workflows, or making technology work just a little bit smarter, I'm always up for the challenge.   

By day, I'm the **President and Owner of Thought Parameters LLC**, leading the charge in cloud computing, cybersecurity, and automation. By night... well, I’m probably still doing the same thing, just with a strong cup of coffee.  

I'm currently working towards earning my **Certificate in Cybersecurity** and a **Bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Cybersecurity Programming**. In other words, I spend a lot of time learning how to keep systems secure while making them run like a well-oiled machine.

## 🛠️ My Tech Journey

I’ve always been drawn to **solving problems with technology**—whether it’s making something run faster, automating a tedious task, or stopping security threats before they start. My background includes everything from **software development** to **cloud infrastructure**, **security compliance**, and **process automation**.  

Some highlights of my work:  
✔ **Making systems smarter** – Automating processes so people can focus on the important stuff.  
✔ **Keeping things secure** – Cybersecurity isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a necessity.  
✔ **Cloud engineering** – Because the future is in the cloud, and I like working in the future.  

I believe that **technology should work for us, not the other way around**. If you’ve ever spent hours fixing a “small” issue that turned into an all-nighter, you know exactly what I mean.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools  

These are some of the tools I use regularly:  

- **Languages**: Python, Bash, Terraform  
- **Cloud**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Azure  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Terraform  
- **Security**: Identity & Access Management (IAM), DevSecOps  
- **Automation**: Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible
